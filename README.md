Overview of the Project

Project: Password Strength Checker

Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a reliable and efficient password strength checker tool that evaluates the strength of a user’s password based on criteria such as length, complexity, and uniqueness. This tool aims to help users create stronger, more secure passwords by providing immediate feedback and recommendations to enhance password quality. By assessing factors like the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and avoiding common patterns, the tool encourages users to adopt passwords that are harder to guess or crack, thereby enhancing overall cybersecurity.

Key Activities

1. Requirements Gathering:

Identify essential password criteria (e.g., length, complexity, uniqueness) to define what constitutes a strong password.

2. Designing the Algorithm:

Develop an algorithm to assess password strength based on length, character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters), and uniqueness.

Define scoring criteria to categorize passwords as weak, moderate, or strong.

3. Implementing the Password Checker:

Write Python code to implement the password checker functionality, using regular expressions to check for specific character patterns.

Ensure the program can calculate a score based on the criteria and provide feedback accordingly.

4. Testing and Validation:

Test the tool with various passwords to validate that it accurately assesses strength.

Use common weak passwords, dictionary words, and complex patterns to test effectiveness.

Gather feedback on usability and make adjustments to improve the tool.

5. Providing User Feedback:

Develop a clear feedback mechanism that provides users with actionable suggestions to improve weak or moderate passwords.

Include specific feedback on each strength factor (e.g., “Add uppercase letters” or “Increase length”).

6. Documentation:

Document the project’s objective, methodology, code comments, and user instructions.

Provide a user guide on how to use the password strength checker effectively.

7. Enhancements and Future Improvements (optional):

Explore additional features, like checking against a larger database of common passwords or calculating password entropy for advanced strength metrics.

Technologies Used

Programming Languages:
Python: A popular choice due to its simplicity and availability of libraries like re (regular expressions) for pattern matching.
